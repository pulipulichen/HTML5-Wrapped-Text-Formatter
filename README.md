In the knowledge-centric
enterprise, in which KM is the established management
philosophy/practice, Knowledge Development/Know-
ledge Sharing (KD/KS) is ‘‘. . .a framework for learning
that embodies the highest objectives of knowledge
management, and combines them with the basic princi-
ples of the learning organization and the teaching organ-
ization. . . Knowledge Development/Knowledge Sharing
builds on the assumption that all learning stakeholders
accept their responsibility to develop, to learn, and to
share both tacit and explicit knowledge within the
enterprise. The concept of KD/KS exists for the bene-
fit of the organizational enterprise with which the learn-
ing stakeholders are affiliated and which provides sup-
port for their learning endeavors, and for the growth
and development of these stakeholders as lifelong
learners.’’[19]
