Abstract
Purpose – This work seeks to present a reading annotation and knowledge sharing tool, which can
annotate a web page with HTML format archived by the Taiwan libraries’ history digital library
based on Web 2.0 technologies
Design/methodology/approach – This work adopted DSpace, an open-source institutional
repository system, to implement a Taiwan Digital Library History Library with the reading
annotation tool for knowledge archiving and sharing services. A quasi-experimental design method
was employed to randomly assign participants to an experimental group and control group to evaluate
differences in the reading performance of learners who used the proposed annotation system. A
statistical analysis scheme was employed to evaluate differences in learning performance of learners
while reading and learning with the proposed annotation tool.
Findings – The paper ﬁnds that annotated digital material provides useful knowledge to readers. The
values to those annotating and subsequent readers are the acquisition of in-depth knowledge and efﬁcient
reading. Additionally, the effect on digital libraries is that digital library content grows dynamically as
readers contribute knowledge. More importantly, annotated information from different readers has very
high potential for the discovery of value-added knowledge utilizing data mining techniques.
Originality/value – Collecting user-generated content is a novel research issue in the library sciences
ﬁeld, and few studies have developed useful tools that allow readers to actively contribute their
knowledge to digital libraries. This work shows how to implement such digital library systems and how
the annotation tool beneﬁts the growth of digital archives and promotes learning performance.
